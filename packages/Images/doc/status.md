# TODOs

## I/O

- TIFF files have been reported to cause trouble when read by ImageMagick,
although many such files do work. If you experience trouble, an alternative can
be found at https://github.com/rephorm/TIFF.jl
- DICOM files are here: https://github.com/ihnorton/DICOM.jl. It would be good
  to synchronize this with Images

## Algorithms

We could still use more of these!
